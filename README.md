# Inqlude data repository

This is the repository for library meta data of Qt based libraries for Include,
the independent Qt library archive.

See https://github.com/cornelius/inqlude for more details about the command line
interface for accessing the archive.

If you would like to contribute data about Qt based libraries, you can do that
by sending a patch for the inqlude-data repository. See the
[specification of the manifest format](https://github.com/cornelius/inqlude/blob/master/manifest-format.md)
